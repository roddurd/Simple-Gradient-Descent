# Simple-Gradient-Descent
A simple implementation of nonlinear regression for modeling first or second order polynomial functions via gradient descent.


As explained in the program, data files should have one value pair (X,Y) per line.
X and Y values should be separated by a comma, space, or tab.

This is just a toy program to help solidify my understanding of gradient descent as I learn.
This is not meant to be a super accurate program.

If you have any questions, for whatever reason, email me at roddurd@gmail.com
